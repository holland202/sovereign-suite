# Phase 2C Governance Toolkit — Master Guide
**Complete Implementation of Sovereign Logic Core on Galaxy S25 Ultra**

---

## 🎯 What This Is

A **complete, production-ready governance layer** for Sovereign Logic Core. Sits between GGUF inference and SIC state modification, enforcing topological safety via two audits:

1. **PreInferenceGate** — Predictive risk evaluation (rejects obvious bad inferences early)
2. **Commit Gate** — Five topological/thermodynamic audits (prevents corruption of SIC manifold)

**Result:** Fully governed, audited inference pipeline with live monitoring on S25 Ultra.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **The One-Way Crystallization Membrane**

Phase 2C enforces a hard rule: **LLM output never touches SIC directly.**

Instead, all writes go through a chain of audits:

```
User Prompt
    ↓
[STEP 4] PreInferenceGate
    • Evaluates: prompt entropy, SIC distance, cognitive pressure, history variance
    • Decides: should we even call GGUF? (early rejection saves inference time)
    • Output: pass/reject decision + risk score
    ├─ REJECT → record deferral, skip GGUF
    ↓ PASS
[STEP 5] GGUF Inference
    • Generates output with logprobs
    • Extracts logit_variance (Fisher information)
    ├─ FAIL → record failure
    ↓ SUCCESS
[STEP 6a] Draft Delta
    • Estimate what SIC state change would be
    • Compute topological strain (dry-run, no modification yet)
    ├─ FAIL → reject
    ↓ SUCCESS
[STEP 6b] Commit Gate Audit (5 checks)
    1. Fisher Sharpness: logit_variance ≥ 0.85?
    2. Spectral Norm: ‖UV^T‖₂ ≤ 2.0?
    3. Rank Preservation: rank unchanged?
    4. Geodesic Distance: Stiefel distance ≤ 0.15?
    5. Thermal Coupling: effective temperature ≥ threshold?
    • Decision: ALL checks must pass (AND logic)
    ├─ ANY FAIL → reject
    ↓ ALL PASS
[STEP 7] SIC.update() ← ONE GATE
    • Irreversible write to manifold
    • Record in CrystallizationMemory
    ↓
[STEP 8+] Continue cycle (UME, SMA, etc.)
```

**Guarantee:** SIC is modified ONLY if ALL gates pass.

---

### **Key Components**

#### **1. SIC Enhancement** (`core/sic.py`)
Added two methods:
- `get_state_for_gate()` — Lightweight snapshot for gates to read (U, V, rank, spectral_norm_U)
- `compute_scar_cost()` — Estimate topological strain before actual update (dry-run)

**Why:** Gates need manifold state without deep coupling or modifying it.

#### **2. CrystallizationMemory** (`crystallization_memory.py`)
Tracks history of crystallization events:
- `delta_history` — Logit variance from each scar
- `pressure_history` — Topological/thermal strain per event
- `rejection_history` — Which events were rejected

**Why:** PreInferenceGate uses history (variance, pressure) to predict future risk.

#### **3. PreInferenceGate** (`pre_inference_gate.py`)
4-factor predictive risk evaluation BEFORE GGUF:
1. **Prompt Entropy** (0.25 weight) — Is input OOD/adversarial?
2. **Identity Distance** (0.30 weight) — Is SIC state drifting?
3. **Cognitive Pressure** (0.25 weight) — Is system tired/over-loaded?
4. **Variance Term** (0.20 weight) — Has history been unstable?

**Output:** Soft probability (sigmoid boundary, not hard threshold) + risk breakdown.

**Why:** Prevents expensive GGUF calls when manifest risk is high.

#### **4. TransferController** (`transfer_controller.py`)
One-way membrane + Commit Gate audit:
- `draft_delta()` — Estimate proposed SIC change (dry-run)
- `commit_gate_audit()` — 5-check topological audit
- `crystallize()` — Actual SIC.update() call (only if audit passes)

**Why:** All SIC modifications go through here. Clean audit trail.

#### **5. Monitor Dashboard** (`monitor_governance.py`)
Real-time Termux-friendly display of:
- Hardware (temperature, thermal state)
- PreGate metrics (pass rate, risk score)
- CommitGate metrics (Fisher, geodesic, acceptance rate)
- Crystallization stats (success rate, scars)
- Memory state (variance, pressure)

**Why:** Instant visual feedback on governance health. Enables quick tuning.

#### **6. Test/Calibration Scripts**
- `smoke_test_2c.py` — Validate setup (no GGUF needed, uses mock engine)
- `calibrate_governance.py` — Main loop with tuning capability

**Why:** Smoke test = confidence gates work. Calibration = find optimal thresholds.

---

### **Engine Integration** (`core/engine.py`)

The 10-step cycle now includes governance:

```
OLD (Phase 1)              NEW (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
1. Thermal (Veritas)       1. Thermal (unchanged)
2. VEST auth               2. VEST auth (unchanged)
3. SMA optimization        3. SMA optimization (unchanged)
[no governance]            4. PreInferenceGate [NEW]
[direct inference]         5. GGUF inference [NEW]
[direct SIC write]         6. Commit Gate audit [NEW]
7. Scar formation          7. Scar formation (after gate)
8. UME dynamics            8. UME dynamics (unchanged)
9. SMA flow                9. SMA flow (unchanged)
10. Telemetry              10. Telemetry (unchanged)
```

Steps 1–3, 7–10 are **unchanged**. Steps 4–6 are **new governance**.

## 📊 Understanding the Dashboard

The monitor shows real-time metrics. Here's what each means:

### **HARDWARE**
```
Temperature:    42.5°C  State: OK
```
- **Green** (<40°C): Normal
- **Yellow** (40–45°C): Warm, acceptable
- **Red** (>45°C): Hot, monitor closely; abort >48°C
- **State**: "OK" or "THROTTLE"

### **PRE-INFERENCE GATE**
```
Pass Rate:      75.3%  (847 evals)
Risk Score:     0.542  (0.0–1.0)
```
- **Pass Rate**: % of inferences that passed PreGate (target: 60–80%)
  - Too low (<40%): Lower `pre_gate_threshold`
  - Too high (>95%): Raise `pre_gate_threshold`
- **Risk Score**: Current manifold risk (0.0 = safe, 1.0 = dangerous)

### **COMMIT GATE**
```
Pass Rate:      82.1%  (847 audits)
Fisher Sharp.:  0.881  (≥0.85 required)
Geodesic Dist.: 0.048  (≤0.15 target)
```
- **Pass Rate**: % of PreGate passers that clear Commit Gate (target: 70–85%)
  - Too low: Lower `fisher_threshold` or raise `geodesic_distance_max`
- **Fisher Sharpness**: GGUF output confidence (0.0–1.0)
  - <0.85: Check GGUF quality or lower threshold
- **Geodesic Distance**: Proposed SIC change magnitude
  - <0.10: Very safe
  - 0.10–0.15: Acceptable
  - >0.15: Risky, raise threshold or lower geodesic_max

### **CRYSTALLIZATION**
```
Success Rate:   67.2%  (scar admitted)
Total Scars:    423
```
- **Success Rate**: % of PreGate passers that resulted in SIC.update() (target: 50–70%)
- **Total Scars**: Cumulative SIC modifications

### **CRYSTALLIZATION MEMORY**
```
Variance Term:  0.187  (history stability)
Pressure:       0.342  (thermal burden)
```
- **Variance**: 0.0 = stable, 1.0 = unstable
  - High variance → PreGate will reject more (conservative)
- **Pressure**: 0.0 = fresh, 1.0 = exhausted
  - High pressure → few updates (system tired)
  - Decays exponentially, resets with low crystallization

## 🎮 Running Phase 2C

### **Option 1: Two Tabs** (Recommended)

```bash
# Tab 1: Monitor (foreground, updates every 1–2 seconds)
python3 monitor_governance.py --metrics-file /tmp/governance_metrics.jsonl

# Tab 2: Calibration (foreground, runs to completion)
python3 calibrate_governance.py --mode engine --cycles 300 \
    --fisher-threshold 0.85 --log-file /tmp/governance_metrics.jsonl
```

**Pros:** Easy to switch between monitor and logs  
**Cons:** Requires tab management

---

### **Option 2: Background + Monitor**

```bash
# Start test in background
python3 calibrate_governance.py --mode engine --cycles 300 \
    --fisher-threshold 0.85 --log-file /tmp/governance_metrics.jsonl &

# Monitor in foreground
python3 monitor_governance.py --metrics-file /tmp/governance_metrics.jsonl
```

**Pros:** Single terminal command  
**Cons:** Mixed output, Ctrl+C kills monitor

---

### **Option 3: Launcher Script** (Fully automated)

```bash
./run_phase2c.sh 300 0.85
# Starts monitor + calibration, cleans up on exit
```

**Pros:** One command, clean shutdown  
**Cons:** Less flexibility for live tuning

---

## 🧪 Tuning Workflow

### **Step 1: Baseline (Default Parameters)**
```bash
python3 calibrate_governance.py --mode engine --cycles 300 \
    --fisher-threshold 0.85 --pre-gate-threshold 0.65 \
    --log-file /tmp/governance_metrics.jsonl
```

Monitor and note metrics:
- PreGate pass rate: X%
- CommitGate pass rate: Y%
- Crystallization: Z%

### **Step 2: Identify Issues**

| Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| PreGate <40% | Too strict | Lower `pre_gate_threshold` to 0.60 |
| CommitGate <50% | Fisher too strict | Lower `fisher_threshold` to 0.75 |
| Crystallization <30% | Both gates too strict | Lower both thresholds |
| Pressure >0.8 | System exhausted | Lower `thermal_multiplier` to 0.8 |

### **Step 3: Tune One Parameter**
```bash
# Example: CommitGate was 45%, too strict
# Fix: Lower fisher_threshold
python3 calibrate_governance.py --mode engine --cycles 300 \
    --fisher-threshold 0.75 \
    --log-file /tmp/governance_metrics.jsonl
```

### **Step 4: Verify**
Watch dashboard. Did CommitGate pass rate improve?
- Yes → Move to Step 5
- No → Adjust more, re-run Step 3

### **Step 5: Iterate**
If other metrics are still out of range, adjust another threshold and repeat Step 3–4.

### **Step 6: Validate**
Once all metrics in healthy ranges, run a longer final validation:
```bash
python3 calibrate_governance.py --mode engine --cycles 500 \
    --fisher-threshold 0.75 --pre-gate-threshold 0.65 \
    --log-file /tmp/governance_metrics.jsonl
```

### **Step 7: Document**
Save final thresholds:
```bash
cp /tmp/governance_metrics.jsonl ~/results/final_phase2c_metrics.jsonl
echo "Final params: fisher=0.75, pre_gate=0.65" > ~/results/phase2c_params.txt
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Matrix

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Monitor shows "No metrics file"** | File not written yet (normal) | Wait 2–3 sec; check test is running |
| **Monitor shows "Temperature: unavailable"** | Thermal sysfs not exposed | OK, monitor works without it; try `--thermal-zone 1` |
| **CommitGate pass rate <50%** | Fisher threshold too high | Lower to `0.75` or `0.70` |
| **PreGate pass rate <40%** | PreGate threshold too high | Lower to `0.60` |
| **Crystallization <30%** | Both gates too strict | Lower both thresholds |
| **Temperature >46°C** | Device hot, may throttle | Pause, cool; next run: reduce `--gpu-layers 16` |
| **Ctrl+C doesn't stop test** | Signal handling in loop | Press Ctrl+C again or `pkill calibrate_governance.py` |
| **"GGUF engine not set"** | Using `--mode engine` without GGUF | Use `--mode mock` or ensure GGUF is installed |
| **Pressure stuck >0.8** | System exhausted | Lower `--thermal-multiplier 0.8` |
| **Fisher stuck at 0.80 exactly** | Logprobs extraction not working | See MONITOR_GOVERNANCE_README.md § "One honest caveat" |
